## 2019/02/12
### Agenda
- [X] ~~Review initially proposed [CVE User Registry (CUR) JSON format](https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-User-Registry/blob/master/example-uuid-filename.json)~~ (Complete)

### Notes
* Plan of record is to start over using the existing CUR format as a reference only.
  * Historical context of the existing format was provided.
  * "User Registry" is a misnomer; the format was created /before/ the IAS working group was conceived.
* A key function seems to be keeping historical context as users move between entities


### Action items
- [ ] (all) Please prepare a list of minimum fields/requirements to discuss at the next meeting (2019/02/19)

# Questions
- [ ] Do we need two entities (an Org & a User) or should we use a single entity
- [ ] How do we keep historical and relationship data as users move between CNAs, roles, and responsibilities.
